# The Unified Approach for Group Testing, Heavy Hitter, Compressed Sensing, and Multiple Access Channel
 
## Abstract

The goal of this talk is not to discuss any particular problem or any
particular solution, but to point out the common elements shared by
sparse signal recovery problems such as group testing, heavy hitter,
compressed sensing.  We will see evidence that making progress in one
problem often leads to breakthrough in another.  This naturally begs the
following question: would there be a unified solution that
single-handedly achieves the optimality of all parameters?  Quick answer
is not yet but we are very close.
